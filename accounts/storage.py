		def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
			try:
				this = MyModelName.objects.get(id=self.id)
				if this.MyImageFieldName != self.MyImageFieldName:
					this.MyImageFieldName.delete()
			except: pass
			super(MyModelName, self).save(*args, **kwargs)

		# file_name = name.split('.')[0]
		if self.exists(name):
			os.remove(os.path.join(settings.MEDIA_ROOT, name))
		return name
